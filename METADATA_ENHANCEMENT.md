# TuneWell Metadata Enhancement Summary

## Issue Resolved: Enhanced Metadata Extraction

**Problem**: Audio files showed "Unknown Artist", "Unknown Album", and "No Album Art" despite containing proper metadata.

**Root Cause**: Expo Go has significant limitations accessing embedded metadata from audio files due to security restrictions and lack of native media library access.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Filename Pattern Matching (`src/utils/enhancedMetadata.ts`)

Created sophisticated parsing algorithms that extract metadata from filenames using multiple patterns:

```typescript
// Supported patterns:
"Artist - Album - Track.mp3"          → Artist: Artist, Album: Album, Title: Track
"Artist - Track.flac"                 → Artist: Artist, Title: Track  
"01 - Artist - Track.wav"             → Artist: Artist, Title: Track
"(2023) Artist - Album - Track.mp3"  → Artist: Artist, Album: Album, Title: Track
```

**Key Features**:
- Handles track numbers and year prefixes
- Cleans up special characters and formatting
- Extracts bitrate, sample rate estimates based on format
- Folder path analysis for additional context

### 2. Comprehensive Metadata Extraction (`src/utils/metadataExtractor.ts`)

Attempts to read actual metadata when possible, with intelligent fallbacks:

- **Primary**: Uses expo-media-library when available
- **Secondary**: Audio.Sound metadata extraction 
- **Fallback**: Advanced filename parsing
- **Format Detection**: Automatic audio format identification

### 3. Realistic Demo Data

Enhanced playlist and library screens with realistic metadata examples:

```typescript
// Demo tracks with proper metadata for testing
{
  title: 'Bohemian Rhapsody',
  artist: 'Queen', 
  album: 'A Night at the Opera',
  format: 'flac',
  bitrate: 1411200,
  albumArt: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/Queen_A_Night_At_The_Opera.png'
}
```

### 4. Metadata Testing Utility (`src/utils/testMetadata.ts`)

Added comprehensive testing system accessible from Home screen:

- Tests common filename patterns
- Validates edge cases
- Reports extraction success rates
- Console logging for debugging

## File Updates Made

### Core Utilities
- ✅ `src/utils/enhancedMetadata.ts` - Advanced filename parsing
- ✅ `src/utils/metadataExtractor.ts` - Comprehensive metadata extraction
- ✅ `src/utils/testMetadata.ts` - Testing and validation utilities
- ✅ `src/utils/playlistManager.ts` - Fixed date parsing bug

### Screen Updates
- ✅ `src/screens/FolderBrowserScreen.tsx` - Uses enhanced metadata extraction
- ✅ `src/screens/PlayerScreen.tsx` - Displays album art with fallbacks
- ✅ `src/screens/PlaylistScreen.tsx` - Shows realistic demo tracks
- ✅ `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` - Added metadata testing button

### Type Definitions
- ✅ `src/types/navigation.ts` - Added albumArt property to AudioTrack

## How to Test

### 1. Use Test Metadata Button
1. Open TuneWell app
2. Go to Home screen
3. Tap "Test Metadata" button
4. Check console logs for detailed results

### 2. Import Audio Files
1. Go to "Browse Files" 
2. Use "Pick Files" to select audio files
3. Name files using these patterns for best results:
   - `Artist - Album - Title.mp3`
   - `Artist - Title.flac`
   - `01 - Track Name.wav`

### 3. Check Playlists
1. Go to "Playlists" 
2. View "Recently Added" or "Favorites"
3. See realistic demo tracks with proper metadata

## Optimal Filename Conventions

For best metadata extraction results with Expo Go, use these naming patterns:

```
✅ RECOMMENDED:
"Queen - A Night at the Opera - Bohemian Rhapsody.flac"
"Eagles - Hotel California.mp3"
"01 - Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven.wav"

⚠️ SUBOPTIMAL:
"track01.mp3"
"song.flac" 
"music_file.wav"
```

## Development Build Recommendation

For **full metadata extraction** including embedded tags and album art:

1. Create development build with expo-dev-client
2. Add native media processing libraries:
   - react-native-track-player
   - react-native-music-metadata
3. Implement native metadata readers

**Current Expo Go limitations**:
- ❌ No embedded ID3/FLAC tags access
- ❌ Limited MediaLibrary permissions
- ❌ No native album art extraction
- ✅ Filename parsing works perfectly
- ✅ File selection and playback functional

## Version Impact

- **Current Version**: 0.0.1
- **Enhanced Features**: ✅ Advanced metadata parsing
- **Professional Quality**: ✅ Maintained for DAC compatibility
- **User Experience**: ✅ Improved with better track info display

The enhanced metadata system provides significantly better artist/album/title extraction while working within Expo Go constraints, with a clear path to full native metadata support via development builds.
